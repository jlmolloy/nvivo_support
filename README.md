## Introduction

NVivo is a software tool used for qualitative data analysis. It helps researchers organize and analyze text, audio, video, and image data, making it easier to identify patterns, themes, and insights within the data. With NVivo, users can import, code, and analyze their data, and then create visualizations and reports to communicate their findings.
